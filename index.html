    <p> Jax is a grappler from the mortal kombat world. He's known as the strongest soldier on earth. He was given
        this title even before he lost his arms and was replaced with cybernetic enhancments. As of MK 11, the FGC Fighting
        Game Community has been horrible individuals and need to be punished.
